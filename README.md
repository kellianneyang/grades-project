## Start Times and Grades

Do students earn higher grades in classes that start later?

The answer is yes! The trend line plotted for each level of class difficulty shows a slightly positive slope. This means that students in classes that start later in the day, on average, earn higher grades than others. 

## Course Difficulty and Grades

Do students earn higher grades in easier classes?

The answer is no! From the strip plot above, we can see that most of the average grades for all levels of difficulty cluster around the maximum 4.0. We can also see that there are fewer classes offered at the intermediate level, and even fewer at the advanced level. 

The grades for the elementary level classes do dip down a bit further into the lower values, and the advanced classes have higher grades. This is the opposite of what we thought! It looks like students are earning higher grades in more advanced classes. 

Why might this be? All students take elementary-level classes when they get into college; that's where everyone starts. Students also take elementary-level classes from subjects that they will eventually not major in, so they may not be as interested in those classes. But, as students find out what they are interested in or good at, they start taking intermediate- and advanced-level classes in those subjects. So, we are seeing the effect of better students in certain subjects doing well in their chosen fields. Students who won't do well in advanced classes in a subject don't take them.
